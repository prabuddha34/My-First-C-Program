# ðŸ§  Simple C Program â€“ Playing with Basic Arithmetic

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This is a beginner-friendly C program that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations using both direct code and function calls. It's intentionally written in a slightly **unorthodox style** to explore different ways of writing C, rather than just sticking to textbook examples.

The program includes:
- Direct arithmetic operations (sum, product, difference, division)
- Two custom functions (`sum1` and `product1`) to reinforce modularity

The style is inspired by **Bro Code** tutorials â€” accessible, practical, and encouraging experimentation.

## ðŸ§ª What It Does

When executed, this program:

1. Prints a welcoming and motivational message.
2. Calculates and displays:
   - Sum of 2 and 3
   - Product of 2 and 3
   - Difference of 2 and 3
   - Division of 4 by 2
3. Calls two custom functions:
   - `sum1()` â†’ Calculates 4 + 5 and prints the result
   - `product1()` â†’ Calculates 2 Ã— 4 and prints the result
